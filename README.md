[Store Description Content]

Introduction
Native browser search (Ctrl+F) is functional but often bulky and intrusive. Just Finder! is designed for digital minimalists who need focus, not features they don't use. It provides a lightweight, floating search bar that respects your screen space and privacy.

⚡ What It Does
Just Finder! injects a clean, non-intrusive search interface into your current tab. It allows you to search for text within a webpage with visual precision, offering features that standard browser tools often lack, such as specific "Exact Match" filtering and a draggable interface.

✨ Key Features

Floating & Draggable UI: Move the search box anywhere on your screen. It never blocks the content you are trying to read.

Smart "Ghost" Interface: The result counter remains invisible until you search. If there are no results, it tells you clearly. If there is one result, it stays out of your way.

Precision Filters:

Case Sensitive: Distinguish between "Apple" and "apple".

Exact Match: Find whole words only, avoiding partial matches inside other words.

Zero Layout Shift: Built with Shadow DOM technology to ensure the search tool never breaks or shifts the website's original design.

Visual Highlights: Uses high-contrast Neon Lime (#ccff00) and Pure Green (#00ff00) highlights for instant visibility.

🔒 Privacy & Data Handling
We believe in privacy by design. Just Finder! operates under a strict "Local Execution" policy:

No Data Collection: We do not track your search queries.

No External Servers: The extension runs entirely within your browser's local environment.

Minimal Permissions: We use activeTab to ensure the extension only runs on the specific tab you click on, not on your entire browsing history.
